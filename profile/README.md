# AI:EcoNet - Aalborg University

AI:EcoNet is an AI:X Lab at Aalborg University bridging ecology and computer science to
predict species interactions and network dynamics under environmental change. We build
vision and graph models to accelerate biodiversity monitoring and forecast how ecological
networks are restructured as a result of climate and land use changes.

He founded the company Really A Robot and more recently <a href="https://www.animaldetect.com/">Animal Detect</a>, focusing on accessible AI for animal detection and classification. In his AI:EcoNet PhD, he works with vision transformer and vision–language models to cluster and sort unknown animal imagery more efficiently, improve species classification with hybrid/metric‑learning pipelines, and extract interaction signals between species and their environments (e.g., insects–flowers, birds–fruits) for downstream ecological network modeling.</div> |

He took both his bachelor's and master's degree at AAU, where his master's thesis was on learning representations of DNA sequences. His AI:EcoNet PhD includes work on multi-graph learning, causal learning of ecological networks and learning on temporal networks, all with the goal of improving our understanding of ecological networks and how they react to changing environments.</div> |
|  | Shuangzhulong Li — PhD Fellow, Dept. of Computer Science — [shuali@cs.aau.dk](mailto:shuali@cs.aau.dk)<br><br>**About:** Shuangzhulong Li has a background in machine learning and data science. His PhD project seeks to develop novel representation learning methods for temporal networks. The research will focus on designing scalable algorithms that can efficiently learn from both the structure and the evolution of complex systems. By integrating concepts from graph neural networks, temporal modeling, and large-scale data analysis, the project aims to uncover new ways to represent and interpret dynamic relationships. |
